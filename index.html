    <p>A pancake, also known as a <b>hotcake</b>, <b>griddlecake</b>, or <b>flapjack</b>, is a flat cake, often thin and round, prepared from a <i>starch-based</i> batter that may contain <i>eggs</i>, <i>milk</i>, and <i>butter</i>, and then cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan. It is a type of batter bread. 
        Pancakes may be served at any time of the day or year with a variety of toppings or fillings, but they have developed associations with particular times and toppings in different regions.
        Provided below is a recipe for making the best homemade pancakes using simple ingredients which are ready avaliable in your kictehn. <i>Let's get started.</i> 
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients List</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Flour</b>: We use all-purpose flour for these pancakes, bute other types of flour can be used based on preference</li>
        <li><b>Baking powder</b>: Addition of baking powder keeps the pancakes light and fluffy. <i>Baking soda</i> can be used as a substitute</li>
        <li><b>Sugar</b>: Add just enough sugar to the batter to ensure a great taste</li>
        <li><b>Salt</b>: A pinch of salt is added to the batter to enchance the overall taste</li>
        <li><b>Milk</b>: The milk could be either diary or non-diary as both work for this recipe</li>
        <li><b>Butter</b>: Adds up to the richness of the pancakes, omit salt if the butter being used is salted</li>
        <li><b>Eggs</b>: Helps bind batter together, adding up to moisture of the pancake</li>
        <li><b>Flavor (<i>Nutmerg</i>)</b>: Enhances the flavor as well as taste of pancakes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Make Pancakes From Scratch</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add flour, baking powder and salt in a large bowl then whisk</li>
        <li>Whisk butter, milk, egg, and nutmerg in another bowl</li>
        <li>Stir the wet ingredients into the flour. <strong>As you stir, the batter will start to thicken and get bubbly so avoid mixing too much to keep pancakes fluffy</strong></li>
        <li>Heat frying pan to medium heat and add butter. <em>The butter give pancakes amazing crispy edges</em></li>
        <li>Flip the pancakes when the edges look <i>dry</i> and <i>bubbles</i> appear and pop on the surfaces</li>
        <li>Cook each side for about 2 minutes. <em>Reduce cooking heat if you notice them browning too quickly</em></li>
    </ol>
